Both Decon2LS and DeconMSn use version 2.7 of Xerces
Download it from http://archive.apache.org/dist/xml/xerces-c/Xerces-C_2_7_0/binaries/
(as of March 2012, this file is no-longer available)

This file is also in Subversion at https://prismsvn.pnl.gov/svn/User_Applications/Anoop_Utilities/Xerces

After downloading, unzip the .Zip file to folder C:\xerces-c (or change the folder in your solution properties so that it points to the correct location)
By default, your Xerces folder structure should look like this:


C:\xerces-c
C:\xerces-c\bin
C:\xerces-c\doc
C:\xerces-c\etc
C:\xerces-c\include
C:\xerces-c\lib
C:\xerces-c\msg
C:\xerces-c\samples
C:\xerces-c\scripts
